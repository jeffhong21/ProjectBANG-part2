## Why is LOS Pro being open-sourced?

After years on the Asset Store, we're open-sourcing LOS Pro because we're moving on to new projects and tools. You can read more in our blog post.

100% in the hands of the community, we hope to see the tool flourish, development continue, and any upcoming bugs fixed (the tool should be bug-free as-is).

## Getting started

Clone the repository + submodules, or download the zip file + [the general library](https://github.com/devdogio/general) and place it in Assets/Devdog.

Integrations stored in the Integrations folder may have to be removed, if you do not have these plugins in your project.

## What's included with LOS Pro?

#### Super Lightweight Detection
A super fast & lightweight modular hearing and line of sight solution that is heavily optimized and production ready. 

#### Detect Targets
Detect targets with support for static meshes, skinned meshes, and 2D sprites, or emit audio from objects and setup listeners to hear them.

#### For Both Programmers and Designers
Everything is interface-based, which means only few dependencies, and with PlayMaker support, designers can setup Los PRO too!

#### Detect in 2D AND 3D
With Los Pro you can detect any target (Skinned meshes, static meshes, 2D sprites and any game object).

Using the powerful editors, you can easily set up your desired system, and by either automatically scanning for positions or manually defining them, you'll have everything ready in a matter of minutes.

#### Zones
The zones in Los PRO is a powerful feature to make your game seem more realistic.

The zones are used to change target or observer behavior. For example, in a scene with a dark alley, you can create light sources where targets are more easily detected. Or make it harder to detect targets in dark corners - you name it.

#### Endless Possibilities
With Los PRO you can quickly add countless advanced gameplay elements to your game.

Hide in bushes, hide behind trees, buildings, anything youâ€™d like. By setting up occluders (colliders and/or triggers) Los PRO enables you to make your characters see and hear!
