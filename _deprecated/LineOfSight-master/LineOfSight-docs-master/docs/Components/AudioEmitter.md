# Audio Emitter

The AudioEmitterBehaviour emits an audio audio source every "emit interval" seconds. These audio sources can be listened to using an  [Listener](Listener.md). The Audio emitter behaviour creates an audio source which is pooled by the  [AudioSourceManager](AudioSourceManager.md), which are set as children of the _Managers object.
